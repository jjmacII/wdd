Art has always been one of my passions and I 		am a self-taught artist. After an elderly lady gave me a gourd to work on I fell in 		love with the gourd. Using it as my pallet I began experimenting with different mediums		from weaving, painting, wood burning and many more mediums. I love being creative doing		one of a kind art. I am well known in western North Carolina and you can see more of my		work through out galleries in North Carolina. I also teach classes for local schools and	    in private. If you would like to schedule a time for me to teach a class please email or	    call me for available times. I thank God for giving me the ability to please people with	    my art. It makes me feel great when I hear them say, That's a Gourd?</p>				<aside>			You can also read a recent article that was published by the 			Mountain Laurel<a href="http://thelaurelmagazine.com/news/2012/09/simply-gourd-geous/"> here</a>		</aside>				</article>		<h4>Gallery</h4>		<ul>			<li><img src="images/butterfly.jpg"></li>			<li><img src="images/cutout.jpg"></li>			<li><img src="images/cutoutleaves.jpg"></li>			<li><img src="images/stain.jpg"></li>			<li><img src="images/weave.jpg"></li>		</ul>		<h4>Contact Me</h4>		<ul>			<li>Phone 828-508-2340</li>			<li><a href="mailto:susan.davis@susieqgourds.com">E-mail Me!</a></li>		</ul>		<footer> 	<ul> 		<li>Follow me on facebook for news and updates</li>		<li>For help & support please email the webmaster <a href="mailto:jjmac@me.com">here</a></li>		<li>Copyright 2013 Susieqgourds.com</li>	</ul></footer>	</div>	   </body></html>
