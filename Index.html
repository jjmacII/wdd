I have been		doing gourd art for more than 10 years. Art has always been one of my passions and I 		am a self-taught artist. After an elderly lady gave me a gourd to work on I fell in 		love with the gourd. Using it as my pallet I began experimenting with different mediums		from weaving, painting, wood burning and many more mediums. I love being creative doing		one of a kind art. I am well known in western North Carolina and you can see more of my		work through out galleries in North Carolina. I also teach classes for local schools and	    in private. If you would like to schedule a time for me to teach a class please email or	    call me for available times. I thank God for giving me the ability to please people with	    my art. It makes me feel great when I hear them say, That's a Gourd?</p>					<aside>			You can also read a recent article that was published by the 			Mountain Laurel<a href="http://thelaurelmagazine.com/news/2012/09/simply-gourd-geous/"> here</a>		</aside>				<p id="process"> Before you can start the process of creating something beautiful out of the gourd, you first need to choose the type of gourd you 		want to work on and then clean it. Gourds are grown on the ground and need to be dried before you can begin working on them. It can take a year or 		more to dry a gourd. Once the gourd is dry and looks rotten then you need to scrub it down with soap and water so you have a clean surface to work		on. After cleaning the gourd and letting it dry then you can begin your design process. Gourds can be cut, dyed, or painted on. If you can 		imagine it then it can be created on a gourd. After I am satisfied with how the piece looks I use a clear sealant to help protect the paint.</p>					</article>		</section>		<h3 id="gallery">Gallery</h3>		<ul>			<li><a href="images/butterfly.jpg" title="painted butterfly"><img src="images/butterfly.jpg" alt="Photo of gourd with butterfly on it"></a></li>			<li><a href="images/cutout.jpg" title="cutout of leaves"><img src="images/cutout.jpg" alt="Photo of gourd with cutout of fall leaves"></a></li>			<li><a href="images/cutoutleaves.jpg" title="cutout of fall leaves"><img src="images/cutoutleaves.jpg" alt="Photo of gourd with cutout of fall leaves"></a></li>			<li><a href="images/stain.jpg" title="stained gourd"><img src="images/stain.jpg" alt=" Photo of gourd that is stained"></a></li>		</ul>		<h3 id="shows">Upcoming Shows</h3>			<table>			<tr>				<th>Date</th>				<th>Location</th>				<th>Hours</th>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>May 3rd-5th</td>				<td>Asheville Farmers Market</td>				<td>8am-4pm</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>May 10th-12th</td>				<td>Georgia Art Festival</td>				<td>8am-5pm</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>May 24th-27th</td>				<td>Cherokee Craft Festival</td>				<td>9am-4pm</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>June 7th-9th</td>				<td>Asheville Farmers Market</td>				<td>8am-5pm</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>June 14th-16th</td>				<td>Asheville Farmers Market</td>				<td>8am-5pm</td>			</tr>		</table>				<h3 id="contact">Contact Me</h3>				<form action="mailto:susan.davis@susieqgourds.com" method="get">					<div>				<label for="name_first">First Name</label>				<input type="text" name="name_first" id="name_first"/>			</div>						<div>				<label for="name_last">Last Name</label>				<input type="text" name="name_last" id="name_last"/>			</div>						<div>				<label for="phone">Phone</label>				<input type="text" name="phone" id="phone"/>			</div>						<div>				<label for="email">Email</label>				<input type="text" name="email" id="email"/>			</div>						<div>				<select name="regarding" id="regarding">				  <option>General Inquiry</option>				  <option>Book a Class</option>				  <option>Suggestions</option>				  <option>Site Error</option>				</select>			</div>						<div>				<label for="message">Message</label>				<textarea rows="10" cols="50" name="message" id="message"></textarea>			</div>		</form>										<footer id="page_footer"> 	<ul> 		<li>Follow me on facebook for news and updates</li>		<li>Copyright 2013 Susieqgourds.com</li>	</ul></footer>	</div>	   </body></html>
